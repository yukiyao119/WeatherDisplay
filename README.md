My first project from self-learning. This is a website that shows weather in Portland Maine and converts the degrees from Farenheit to Celcius.

I moved to the US from China. It is the first time that I live in a foreign country. I am not familiar with a new system of measurements. I thought about a super converter website that can converts every measurement for my daily use, starting with the weather!
